    <h1>What is E$D?</h1>
    <p>In a future where money is code and trust is decentralized, E$D – Eurodollari – emerges as a signal. A heartbeat of a new economy, beyond banks, beyond borders.</p>
    <p>E$D is an ERC-20 token on Base Network. Liquid. Transparent. Verified. But most of all, visionary.</p>
    <h2>A Conscious Digital Community</h2>
    <p>We are builders, explorers, creators, thinkers. A community rejecting old models and writing new protocols. E$D is our symbol. AlphaPrime is our voice. Liberation of value is our mission.</p>
    <h2>No Promises. Just Vision.</h2>
    <p>E$D is not an investment. It’s access. A key to a new narrative. A portal to decentralized courage, clarity, and code.</p>
    <h3>Own E$D. Share the code. Leave your trace.</h3>
